These are the Release Notes for EUPS
(Thanks to Mike Blanton, Doug Finkbeiner, Robert Lupton
and David Schlegel for testing the code out, and finding 
all the various problems with it.)

v0_7_16: New features:
	   - Added GNU configure support. (RHL)
	   - Added support for colon-delimited $EUPS_PATHs (CPL)

v0_7_14: Changes to evilinstall in an attempt to support more SDSS products

v0_7_13: Trivial bug fix

v0_7_12: Added version information to -h option; added export commands 
	 to setups.sh

v0_7_4: Trivial bugfix

v0_7_2: Verbosity levels adjusted

v0_7_1: Minor bugfix in extract_table_commands()

v0_7: Continuation of the Great Cleanup
	-- Proper help is now added into the code

	-- Complete rewrite of the extract_table_commands();
	   Now includes support for table files that have a common
	   commands section before the flavor specifications.


v0_6: First tag after the Great Cleanup.

	-- More work on new minimalistic table files; bugs fixed

	-- Significant cleanup/factoring of code

	-- New argument parser in eups_setup

	-- Reduced chatter if $debug == 1 (but can set -v -v to set it to 2)

	-- Indented "Setting up" lines (with -v) to indicate depth of dependency nesting



v0_5: A branch; the first version on this branch (v5_0_0) is identical to v0_4

At this point, the code was enhanced:

	-- EUPS now includes support for minimal table files, or, indeed,
	no table file at all ("-m none")

	-- setupenv and proddir are now deprecated. The appropriate environment
	variables are automatically set.

	-- Removed hardcoded file sizes from eups_setup.pm

	-- Added checks that ensure that the Table files are properly formed.


v0_4 :
	-- evilinstall now uses eups_expandtable

	-- Created eups_expandtable to expand table files

	-- Evilinstall now no longer calls sdssmake with the -idl flag.

	-- The toplevel Makefile now copies over the GPL license and the 
	   Release_Notes


v0_3 : 
    
	-- The Makefile now creates the $(PRODUCTS) (where the database is)
	  and $(PROD_DIR_PREFIX) (where the products are) directories.


v0_2 :  Tagged Saturday, April 5,2003 0130

        -- Fixed bug with setup - now correctly unsets previous setups.
 
        -- -z now propagates the database to all dependencies.

        -- Shifted the perl location to /usr/bin/perl from /usr/local/bin/perl
 
        -- Added the GNU General Public License (gpl.txt).

	-- Table files are now forced to be in the ups/ subdirectory of the 
	product directory, and have to have the name $PRODUCT.table. The -m
	option is still accepted by setup, but is overriden, as is any 
	information about table files in the version files.

	-- eups_declare changed to reflect the changes brought about by
	the above change.

	-- The Makefile has been changed to be Solaris compliant.

	-- Fixed a bug with pathPrepend in the table file reader.

	-- Fixed a bug with command line argument passing in eups_setup
