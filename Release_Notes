These are the Release Notes for EvilUPS
(Thanks to Mike Blanton, Doug Finkbeiner, Robert Lupton
and David Schlegel for testing the code out, and finding 
all the various problems with it.)

v0_2 : 
	-- Table files are now forced to be in the ups/ subdirectory of the 
	product directory, and have to have the name $PRODUCT.table. The -m
	option is still accepted by setup, but is overriden, as is any 
	information about table files in the version files.

	-- eups_declare changed to reflect the changes brought about by
	the above change.

	-- The Makefile has been changed to be Solaris compliant.

	-- Fixed a bug with pathPrepend in the table file reader.

v0_1 : First released version
