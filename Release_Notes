These are the Release Notes for EvilUPS
(Thanks to Mike Blanton, Doug Finkbeiner, Robert Lupton
and David Schlegel for testing the code out, and finding 
all the various problems with it.)


v0_4 :
	-- evilinstall now uses eups_expandtable

	-- Created eups_expandtable to expand table files

	-- Evilinstall now no longer calls sdssmake with the -idl flag.

	-- The toplevel Makefile now copies over the GPL license and the 
	   Release_Notes


v0_3 : 
    
	-- The Makefile now creates the $(PRODUCTS) (where the database is)
	  and $(PROD_DIR_PREFIX) (where the products are) directories.


v0_2 :  Tagged Saturday, April 5,2003 0130

        -- Fixed bug with setup - now correctly unsets previous setups.
 
        -- -z now propagates the database to all dependencies.

        -- Shifted the perl location to /usr/bin/perl from /usr/local/bin/perl
 
        -- Added the GNU General Public License (gpl.txt).

	-- Table files are now forced to be in the ups/ subdirectory of the 
	product directory, and have to have the name $PRODUCT.table. The -m
	option is still accepted by setup, but is overriden, as is any 
	information about table files in the version files.

	-- eups_declare changed to reflect the changes brought about by
	the above change.

	-- The Makefile has been changed to be Solaris compliant.

	-- Fixed a bug with pathPrepend in the table file reader.

	-- Fixed a bug with command line argument passing in evilsetup
