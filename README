2. EvilUPS : Basic Commands

EvilUPS implements the following UPS commands:

a) eups_flavor :

Syntax : eups_flavor [-a] <productname>

Returns the version of a product, by parsing the SETUP_<product> environment
variable. The -a switch returns, in addition to the version, the flavour,
a full path to the version file, and the database used.

b) eups_undeclare :

Syntax : eups_undeclare [-f <flavor>] <product> <version>

Undeclares <version> of <product> from the database. Also removes any declarations of 
this version from current.chain. The flavour is determined from the environment
variable EUPS_FLAVOR, but -f overrides this. The database used is defined by the 
environment variable PRODUCTS.

NOTE: eups_undeclare is designed to be used with eups_declare. It is NOT compatible
with version files that use the "Group: End:" construct.

c) eups_declare:

Syntax : eups_declare [-f <flavor>] [-c] [-m <tablefile>] -r <product root directory> <product> <version>

Declares <version> of <product> into the database defined by $PRODUCTS.
The product root directory is where the product has been installed, and can either be an absolute pathname
or specified relative to $PROD_DIR_PREFIX. The flavour is defined by $EUPS_FLAVOR, unless
the -f option is used. The -c option also declares this version to be current for the flavour, while 
the -m option specifies the table file to be used (either in the database, or in the ups directory of 
the product).

d) evilsetup :

Syntax : evilsetup <"setup"/"unsetup"> <product> [<version>] [-f <flavor>] [-z <database>]

Usage : source `evilsetup <"setup"/"unsetup"> <product> [<version>] [-f <flavor>] [-z <database>]`

This is the workhorse routine. It sets up or unsets  <version> of <product>. The PERL script evilsetup
writes the name of a file to STDOUT that contains the necessary commands to setup/unsetup a product; 
sourcing this file sets up the necessary environment. 

IMPORTANT : Since the commands to set environment variables differ across shells, it is essential that
$SHELL reflects the current shell.

Options:

<"setup"/"unsetup"> - Setup/UnSetup?
<product> - The product name
<version> - The version. If not specified, uses current.chain
[-f <flavor>] - The flavour to set up. If not specified, $EUPS_FLAVOR is used.
[-z <database>] - The database to use. If not specified, $PRODUCTS is used.

Note the following :
(i)   unsetup ignores all inputs except the product name.
(ii)  unsetup fails if $SETUP_<product> is not set.
(iii) Both setup and unsetup are currently very verbose (to STDERR). However,	
      if they are unsuccessful, then the last line will start with "FATAL ERROR".  If not, 
      then the script was successful.
